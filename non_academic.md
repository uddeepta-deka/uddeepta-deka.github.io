Hi! Apart from my research work, I like to delve into several other
activities. My hobbies include (but not limited to) reading fiction, non-
fiction, playing and making music, painting and cycling. I like long-distance
travelling and riding. I am currently learning to play flute and the local 
language of Karnataka - Kannada.

Occassionally, I try to write [here](https://megh-ud.blogspot.com/).
