Apart from my research work, I like to delve into several other
activities. My hobbies include (but not limited to) reading fiction, non-
fiction, playing and making music, painting, playing badminton and cycling. 
I like long-distance travelling and riding. I am currently learning to play the
flute and also learning the local language of Karnataka - Kannada.

Occassionally, I try to scribble my thoughts [here](https://megh-ud.blogspot.com/).
