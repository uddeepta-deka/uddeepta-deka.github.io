Apart from my research work, I like to delve into several other
activities. My hobbies include (but not limited to) reading fiction and non-
fiction, playing and making music, painting, playing badminton and cycling. 
I like long-distance travelling, trekking, riding motorbikes and cars. 
I am currently learning to play the Indian bamboo flute and also 
learning the local language of Karnataka - Kannada.

I occassionally interact with school children and young undergraduate students 
about my work and astronomy in general. I have been
organizing several activities to bridge the gap between academia and public since
my college days. More recently, I along with a few other enthuastic colleagues, 
have been conducting night sky observation sessions, using the ICTS in-house telescope. 
As of now, we have only been able to reach out to a few local kids and their parents.
We have plans to extend our reach in the future.

I am passionate about teaching and mentoring. I have mentored an M.Sc. student 
(Shivashree, St. Joseph College, Bengaluru) for her M.Sc. thesis along with 
Prof. P. Ajith and Aditya Sharma. Moreover, I have mentored young graduate 
students at ICTS for their term papers and projects in different courses 
including the Gravitational Wave Astronomy course.

Occassionally, I try to scribble my thoughts [here](https://megh-ud.blogspot.com/).
