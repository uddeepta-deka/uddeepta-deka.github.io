Hi, I’m Uddeepta! Thanks for visiting my corner of the web—here’s a little about me.

I’m a passionate physicist currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS-TIFR)](https://icts.res.in/), under the guidance of [Prof. Parameswaran Ajith](https://home.icts.res.in/~ajith/Home.html). My research lies at the intersection of theoretical physics, computational modeling, and data analysis, unraveling some of the most profound mysteries of the universe.

I hail from Doomdooma, a small yet culturally rich town in Tinsukia, Assam. My academic journey began with a bachelor's degree in Physics from Ramjas College, University of Delhi, followed by a master's degree in Physics and Astrophysics from the University of Delhi. I later moved to ICTS to pursue my Ph.D. and delve deeper into the fascinating world of gravitational wave astrophysics.

When I’m not exploring astrophysical phenomena, you can find me on the badminton court, catching up with friends, or lost in the pages of a good book from the ICTS library. I also enjoy painting, cycling, trekking, and embarking on long drives. On occasion, I play percussion instruments or the Indian bamboo flute, finding rhythm and melody to be great outlets for creativity.

Languages fascinate me, and I’m currently learning Kannada, the state language of Karnataka, while also diving into American Sign Language (ASL).

I’m passionate about science outreach and love engaging with students of all ages. From organizing public talks and night sky observation sessions with ICTS’s in-house telescope to collaborating with the ICTS Outreach Team on activities for local schools, I strive to bridge the gap between academia and the broader community. Teaching and mentoring are close to my heart; I’ve guided an M.Sc. student, Shivashree (St. Joseph College, Bengaluru), on her thesis and supported graduate students at ICTS with term papers and projects in courses like Gravitational Wave Astronomy.

Occasionally, I jot down my thoughts and musings on my [blog](https://megh-ud.blogspot.com/).—feel free to check them out here.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope we can connect to share ideas, curiosity, and a passion for exploring the cosmos!
