Hi I'm Uddeepta. Thanks for dropping by! Here's a little something about me ...


I am a physics enthusiast, currently pursuing a PhD at the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences](https://icts.res.in/) 
(ICTS-TIFR), working under the supervision of [Prof. Parameswaran Ajith](https://home.icts.res.in/~ajith/Home.html). 
My work lies at the intersection of theory, computation, and data analysis, aiming to uncover deeper insights into the universe's most enigmatic phenomena. 


I was born and brought up in the small and culturally vibrant town
of Doomdooma in Tinsukia, Assam. I completed my undergraduate in Physics from Ramjas College, University of Delhi. 
Following this, I joined the Department of Physics and Astrophysics at the University of Delhi as a master's student before moving to ICTS.

When I’m not delving into astrophysical puzzles, you’ll find me playing badminton or catching up with some old friends. I frequently pay visits to
the ICTS library to get hold of some fascinating fiction or non-fiction books.
