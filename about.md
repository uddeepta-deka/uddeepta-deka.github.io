<p>Hi there! Thanks for dropping by. I am a physics student, currently
pursuing a Ph.D. at the **[International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, 
Bengaluru, India](https://icts.res.in/)**. </p>

of Doomdooma in Tinsukia, Assam. I did my undergrad in Physics at Ramjas College, 
University of Delhi, Delhi. After which, I joined the Department of Physics and 
Astrophysics at the University of Delhi as a masters student.</p>
