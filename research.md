# Research

I am interested in working on various aspects of Gravitational Wave astrophysics. Currently, my 
work revolves around the Gravitational Lensing of Gravitational Waves (GWs). 

Before delving into the world of GWs, I spent some time working with Dr. Sushan Konar, 
at NCRA-TIFR, Pune, on _nulling pulsars_. The published work can be found here:
- Konar S., **Deka U.**
     *Radio pulsar sub-populations (I): The curious case of nulling pulsars*.
     [Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy, Indian Academy of Sciences, 2019](https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/joaa/040/05/0042), 
     [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07681).
     
My current works on microlenisng (diffraction) effects of gravitational lensing of GWs are listed here: 
- **Deka U.**, Chakraborty S., Kapadia S.J., Shaikh M.A., Ajith P.
      *Probing black hole charge with gravitational microlensing of gravitational waves*. 
      [arXiv, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06553).
