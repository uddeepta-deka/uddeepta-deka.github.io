# Research

I am interested in working on various aspects of Gravitational Wave astrophysics. Currently, my 
work revolves around the Gravitational Lensing of Gravitational Waves. 

Before delving into the world of Gravitational Waves, I spent some time working with Dr. Sushan Konar, 
at NCRA-TIFR, Pune, on _nulling pulsars_. The published work can be found here:
- Konar, S., **Deka, U.**
     *Radio pulsar sub-populations (I): The curious case of nulling pulsars*.
